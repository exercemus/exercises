## An open source exercise list curated from exercemus and wger.de

After struggling to find an easy-to-use, open source exercise list for exercemus, I decided to curate this open source list. The initial list was created from wger.de (big thanks to that project). In the future, as exercises are submitted to exercemus by users, they will also be added to this repository for all to enjoy. It is my personal belief that data like that provided here should be readily accessible by all.

## Licensing Notes
All code in this repository is under the MIT License to enable free use. However, all exercises in this repository have a license associated with them that you must follow. Only exercises with a (relatively) free open source license are included in this repository, but care must be taken to ensure that you meet each exercise's licensing requirements.

## Usage
The following data files were created by `python3 parser.py`:
- `all_data.json` contains all data that I parsed from wger.de in an easier format
- `all_exercises.json` contains all (ready-to-use) exercises from wger.de
- `exercises_en.json` contains all (ready-to-use) English exercises from wger.de

# NOTICE
This list is still a big WIP, so please expect format changes. However, feel free to use the data as-is.
