    "Stand up straight while holding a dumbbell in each hand and with an incline bench in front of you.",
    "While keeping your back straight and maintaining the natural arch of your back, lean forward until your forehead touches the bench in front of you. Let the arms hang in front of you perpendicular to the ground. The palms of your hands should be facing each other and your torso should be parallel to the floor. This will be your starting position.",

Exhale as you lift the weights. Caution: avoid swinging the torso or bringing the arms back as opposed to the side.",
