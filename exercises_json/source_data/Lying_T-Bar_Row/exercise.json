    "Lift the bar off the rack and extend your arms in front of you. This will be your starting position.",
    "As you exhale slowly pull the weight up and squeeze your back at the top of the movement. Tip: Keep the upper arms as close to the torso as possible throughout the movement in order to better engage the back muscles. Also, do not lift your body off of the pad at any time and refrain from using the biceps to lift the weight.",
    "After a second contraction at the top of the movement, as you inhale, slowly go back down to the starting position.",
