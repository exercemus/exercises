    "Grasp the end of the band with your right hand, and keep your elbow pressed firmly to your side. We recommend you hold a pad or foam roll in place with your elbow to keep it firmly in position.",
    "With your upper arm in position, your elbow should be flexed to 90 degrees with your hand reaching across the front of your torso. This will be your starting position.",
    "Execute the movement by rotating your arm in a backhand motion, keeping your elbow in place.",
    "Continue as far as you are able, pause, and then return to the starting position."
