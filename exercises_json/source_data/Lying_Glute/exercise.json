    "Attempt to push your leg towards your partner, who should be preventing any actual movement of the leg.",
    "After 10-20 seconds, completely relax as your partner gently pushes the ankle and knee towards your chest. Be sure to inform your helper when the stretch is adequate to prevent injury or overstretching."
