    "To begin, first set the bar to a position that best matches your height. Once the bar is loaded, step under it and position it across the back of your shoulders.",
    "Take the bar with your hands facing forward, unlock it and lift it off the rack by extending your legs.",
    "Move your feet forward about 18 inches in front of the bar. Position your legs using a shoulder width stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Look forward at all times and maintain a neutral or slightly arched spine. This will be your starting position.",
    "Slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper and lower leg breaks 90 degrees.",
    "Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heels of your feet, extending the knees and returning to the starting position.",
    "Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
