    "Initiate the exercise by extending one leg, straightening the knee and hip to bring the leg just above the ground.",
    "Maintain the position of your lumbar and pelvis as you perform the movement, as your back is going to want to arch.",

    "Repeat on the opposite side, alternating until the set is complete."
