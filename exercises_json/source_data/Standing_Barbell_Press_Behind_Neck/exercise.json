    "This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for easier pick up of the bar. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.",
    "Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.",
    "Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Your back should be kept straight while performing this exercise. This will be your starting position.",
    "Elevate the barbell overhead by fully extending your arms while breathing out.",
    "Hold the contraction for a second and lower the barbell back down to the starting position by inhaling.",
    "Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
