    "This drill helps you learn the snatch. Begin by holding a light weight across the back of the shoulders. Your feet should be slightly wider than hip width apart with the feet turned out, the same position that you would perform a squat with.",
    "Begin by dipping with the knees slightly, and popping back up to briefly unload the bar. Drive yourself underneath the bar, elevating it overhead as you descend into a full squat.",
    "Return to a standing position."
